## Hello!

My name is Jake Frances-Fischer, and I am a junior studying for my BA in Studio Arts with minors in Psychology and Photography/Videography at [Christropher Newport University](https://cnu.edu/)

From a university standpoint, I have taken courses expanding upon various mediums of art, and I have experience using Adobe Photoshop, Camera Raw, Illustrator, and Premier Pro. Moving away from the digital realm, I am also able to use a film darkroom, and can process and develop film from start to finish.
