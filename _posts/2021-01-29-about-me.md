## Hello!

My name is Jake Frances-Fischer, and I am a junior studying for my BA in Studio Arts with minors in Psychology and Photography/Videography at [Christropher Newport University](https://cnu.edu/)

From a university standpoint, I have taken courses expanding upon various mediums of art, and I have experience using Adobe Photoshop, Camera Raw, Illustrator, and Premier Pro. My personal favorite production can be found [**here**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fBbIPK90uM50xy7v1GlLcehvBp4bR1R3/view?usp=sharing)

Moving away from the digital, I am also able to use a film darkroom, and can process and develop film from start to finish. I particularly gravitate towards the outdoors, and my dream is to work as a landscape/wildlife photographer, ideally within the film realm. 

In 2017, I spent 72 _days_ living in the woods of northern Vermont completing a wilderness program. Throughout this time I learned how to build small game traps, shelters, and friction fires, and how to identify the surrounding flora and fauna. Every encounter had a viable relevance to real world situations, and on top of that, if I ever find myself in a _Lost_ situation, I'd like to think I'm covered. 

Aside from Vermont, I have summited 3 of the Adirondack 46ers in upstate New York, as well as natural-face rock climbed in both the Adirondack mountains and Joshua Tree State Park.

I have also worked as a camp counselor at Camp Silver Beach on the Eastern Shore of Virginia, spending 12 weeks helping belay and run their climbing and zip-line structures. 

Above all else, music is an integral part of my life. I play the piano and tenor saxophone, and I am also a member of the all-male a cappella group at CNU called Expansion. I currently am on the electoral board and I hold the position of PR Manager

I have a one year old tuxedo cat named Misty, and in my spare time (while she's not biting me), I enjoy designing graphics for clothing and I am always game for a spontaneous adventure.
