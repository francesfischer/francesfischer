Livingstone Online: Illuminating Imperial Exploration expands upon the life of Victorian era missionary and pioneer David Livingstone. Having traveled through Africa for a combined 20+ years throughout the mid 1800’s, Livingstone had written a wide array of manuscripts concerning a vast amount of subjects (from fungi in tropical Africa, to East African urbanization.) Widely regarded as a prolific explorer throughout the 19th century, Livingstone’s documentation provides some of the only known information on certain regions within Africa. The goal of this project is to compile any information written by Livingstone and to allow the reader to educate themselves on Imperial Britain and their interactions with and in Africa. 

The home page of the site offers a comprehensive site guide, image credits, external blog link, and six available links that allow the reader to explore the various facets of the project. Virtually any part of the website is accessible from any page and it is easily navigable. An Overview page is also available within each section to provide links to and brief descriptions of the various manuscripts and other information housed on this website. This ease of access can help a reader stay more engaged, due to a more streamlined layout.

Information concerning the makeup of the project is hard to find and is spread out into separate sections. Their TEI P5 Guidelines are listed in their “Resources” tab, and a difficult to understand site setup section can be found in their “Behind the Scenes” tab. With that being said,  however, it operates smoothly on both a computer and a mobile device. The layout of the project is very well executed and easy to maneuver, featuring things like a “Top” button to help return the reader to the specific page’s index if the reader has scrolled down the page.

The Livingstone Online project functions under the belief that the future of our accessibility to history is in technology and digital accessibility. Providing access to some of the only known information on social organization, politics, and technologies used during the 1800’s in Africa grants an opportunity to expand our perceptions of 19th century imperial British and African history.

Existing as a public project with 51 listed collaborators, Livingstone Online is based mainly in the UK and USA, and work together in order to continue the preservation and accumulation of Livingstone documents. This site is listed as an MLA Approved Edition and has also been peer reviewed and approved by NINES. 

Given that supplies was in short order for Livingstone to write his documents, he often had to use unconventional writing means such as berry ink written cross-ways on newspaper. Livingstone Online boasts that it uses spectral imaging in order to decipher some of the century and a half old manuscripts. With almost 3,000 links available within the Livingstone Online Digital Collection, along with an easy to find transcription button in order to help the reader view the writings via digital text, this catalog lists anything for, from, and about David  Livingstone.  

This project provides a massive amount of history concerning the imperial British empire and their exploration through Africa. The Livingstone Online project aims at illuminating the value of digital archives and museums, and with the easily maneuverable and open access layout that this project provides, they certainly meet their mark.
