# Ecounters with Oxygen
#### By: Jake Frances-Fischer

I was given the task of coding pages 27 through 30 of the short story, “The Yellow Wall-paper,” written by Charlotte Perkins Stetson. In order to assist in turning this semi-autobiography into a digital format, I used Oxygen, an XML (eXtensible Markup Language) editor following TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) guidelines. Before diving directly into Oxygen, however, my section was copied into a Google Doc to gain some experience on finding what to annotate and why. 

The Google Document was a perfect testing ground for the project ahead. Using the “comment” function, I highlighted page breaks, em-dashes, odd spacings, and a lot more. Initially, this was overwhelming. With comments quickly filling the side bar of my screen, it was hard not to think I was annotating _too much_. Having to read and re-read each line made me quite familiar with my portion of the story, and both intriguing and saddening to view the narrators anxieties from her perspective.

When it comes to technology, I would like to think that I am at least competent, however, when I opened Oxygen, I found quickly that I was in an unknown territory. To start, I clicked something wrong and ended up with a blank template, and while I didn’t know much at that point, I knew that was not right. Luckily, I have a friend who is a computer science major who happens to be taking this course as well, so he was able to help me digest the various tags and formatting of the code. 

Once I had everything processed, Oxygen felt more like a puzzle than anything else. The ```<p></p>``` (paragraph) tags acted as the boarders for the text, while tags such as ```&#8212;``` (the em-dash tag) and ```<space/>``` (added space tag) were dropped into their respective slots. I felt as if I was working with the text not on it, as I underlined and struck through text, each using a specific line of code.

Despite having some hiccups at the beginning, I ultimately enjoyed this assignment. After I got the help I needed, I felt far more confident, and as I progressed through the coding process, that confidence only increased. I think that this is not only an important way to convert tangible text into a digital platform, but also a wonderful structure in which to analyze a text and become truly familiar with its intent.
