# Ecounters with Oxygen
#### By: Jake Frances-Fischer

I was given the task of coding pages 27 through 30 of the short story, “The Yellow Wall-paper,” written by Charlotte Perkins Stetson. In order to assist in turning this semi-autobiography into a digital format, I used Oxygen, an XML (eXtensible Markup Language) editor following TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) guidelines. Before diving directly into Oxygen, however, my section was copied into a Google Doc to gain some experience on finding what to annotate and why.

The Google Document was a perfect testing ground for the project ahead. Using the “comment” function, I highlighted page breaks, em-dashes, odd spacings, and a lot more. Initially, this was overwhelming. With comments quickly filling the side bar of my screen, it was hard not to think I was annotating _too much_. Having to read and re-read each line made me quite familiar with my portion of the story, and both intriguing and saddening to view the narrators anxieties from her perspective.
