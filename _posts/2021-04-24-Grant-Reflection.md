# Semester in Reflection 

When the grant project was first introduced to the class, I immediately had a flashbulb idea for what I wanted my grant to entail. As a studio arts major, I am personally drawn to the potentially creative aspects within every class I take, and this assignment was certainly no exception. I wanted to base my project off of my preferred medium (photography), and thought of an interactive mapping website that walks one through both technological and historical advancements in photography.

While there are timelines and websites available concerning the history of photography, there are no set projects that allow a viewer to see how widespread these developments were across the world. My thought behind this is that allowing the user an opportunity to see how many different places across the world call an advancement to photography home can cause an increase in interest of the art form.

Writing for this grant and for this class as a whole has made me think about writing with intention, and relaying any necessary information in an easily digestible fashion. I remember on one of the first days of class, Dr. Stover discussed the benefits of breaking up text not only with  paragraph breaks, but with images, links, and other media. Even the simple use of bold or italics can help draw the reader’s attention and push them to keep reading. 

This class initially caught my eye when signing up for my spring classes at the end of last semester. I had taken a post-humanism course my sophomore year, and upon seeing the words “digital” and “humanities” grouped together, I believed I was basically signing up for a Black Mirror deep dive Writing Intensive. Although I was incredibly mistaken, I believe that this course has helped me to develop a lot of tools that can be used in my desired career path.

Learning how to build a GitHub repository and TEI were initially two things that I was apprehensive about. However, after submitting our first blog post, I found GitHub to be relatively straightforward, and it now feels incredibly rewarding to be able to put together a website (in some fashion) from start to finish. While I enjoyed the TEI project, I learned via the comments after I had turned it in that I had issues with some of the coding. I think that I would have enjoyed it more had we explored it more in depth throughout class.

Twitter was something else that I was initially nervous about, but quickly fell into a groove with. As I’ve gotten older, I have found myself spending less and less time on social media, and Twitter was a platform that I had never used. With that being said though, I quickly found to enjoy using this compared to discussion boards. The character limit and general flow of Twitter make it easy to have discussions in a short and sweet manner. 

Being able to review other students work during peer reviews and any examples posted in the drive throughout the year were both incredibly beneficial I am personally an experiential learner, and gaining a separate perspective on how others navigate a prompt tends to help me out a lot. The readings assigned were also useful, and allowed me to directly apply anything I learned from them to whatever project we were working on at the time. 

To conclude, while this wasn’t really content specific, this was the only in person class that I have had all year. Being able to have the consistency of getting out of my room and being in a classroom three times a week was a breath of fresh air, and I especially enjoyed the relaxed environment. The open discussion style of the class also helped me to stay engaged and interested in the topic, and it sparked a new interest in the digital humanities within me that I hope to cultivate.
