   The Van Gogh Letters Project (VGLP) is a digital humanities project ran by the Van Gogh Museum in collaboration with Huygens Institute for Dutch History (ING). The goal of this project is to grant open access to all documented letters that Van Gogh either wrote himself or received. With the majority of Van Gogh’s letters being written primarily in Dutch or French, VGLP provides translations for the 900+ notes available on the website, along with scans and digital renditions of the documents in their original languages. The website as a whole is also written in English, in order to engage a wider platform of specialists and scholars interested in Van Gogh.

   Each document is individually coded using XML , allowing the reader to comprehensively review every single letter. The website itself  uses the Ruby programming language, a coding language commonly used for building websites. The Lucene search engine grants quick and easy (or advanced) searching of specific letters based off of keyword or number. ImageMagic software is used for the artworks available on the website to allow the viewer to zoom and scale the images. 

   For the most part, the project design itself is very simple, which allows for easy access on both mobile devices and computers. The main dashboard feature that lets you maneuver throughout the project is well organized and thorough, and the links change color before you click, which is a nice touch as well. With all that being said, however, the simplicity does lead to some minor shortcomings. The initial view page of the letters is a single column list featuring the nearly one thousand thousand notes that are available on the website. This can be overwhelming, and while there are four separate links featured in the dashboard that allow for further organization (by place, correspondent, period, or with sketches), perhaps removing the initial view page all together and opening to the aforementioned labels instead would be less visually flooding. 
   
   While the VGLP may have some slight organizational issues concerning the letters, when it comes to what the project was designed for — reading and analyzing Van Gogh’s written and received letters — the website excels. The two option bars permitting the reader to view the document side by side with translations, notes, and artworks associated are well organized, and the website also quick-saves recently viewed letters allowing the reader to jump from one document to another.

   Aside from the textual analysis, the rest of the website is also well laid out and organized. Text in it of itself may be highly concentrated at times, however, there is a convenient sidebar offered, which lets the reader to jump to different sections of the various readings.
   
   Overall, the Van Gogh Letters Project is comprehensive, through, and easy to navigate., This website grants an accessible platform in order to analyze the large amount of letters to their fullest extent. While there are some minor organizational issues, the project makes up for it in more ways than one, and it could easily be used an important asset for those who specialize in or are interested in Van Gogh.
