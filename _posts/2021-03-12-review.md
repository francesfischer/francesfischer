  The Van Gogh Letters Project (VGLP) is a digital humanities project ran by the Van Gogh Museum in collaboration with Huygens Institute for Dutch History (ING). The goal of this project is to grant open access to all documented letters that Van Gogh either wrote himself or received. With the majority of Van Goghâ€™s letters being written primarily in Dutch or French, VGLP provides translations for the 900+ notes available on the website, along with scans and digital renditions of the documents in their original languages. The website as a whole is also written in English, in order to engage a wider platform of specialists and scholars interested in Van Gogh. 

	Each document is individually coded using XML , allowing the reader to comprehensively review every single letter. The website itself  uses the Ruby programming language, a coding language commonly used for building websites. The Lucene search engine grants quick and easy (or advanced) searching of specific letters based off of keyword or number. ImageMagic software is used for the artworks available on the website to allow the viewer to zoom and scale the images.
